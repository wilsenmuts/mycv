# mycv
This project looks at creating abasic cv site with only html and css

Gone  are the days when people used to use hard paper to present their cvs. In the current world the use of soft copies is taking over. This has led to a new trend of writing CVs on the internet making them available remotely and accessible to anyone interested in them at any time.This is so unlike the past times where one had to present their cvs manually and one had to wait for one to avail themselve to get a glimpse of their cv.
This project shows the making of Online cvs using HTML and CSS. There is no php or javascript involved unless there is need to make something more sophisicated. I believe simplicity or complexity deliver the same if both are used optimumly
